# Applied diagnostic classification modeling with R

Diagnostic classification models (DCMs; also called cognitive diagnostic models [CDMs]) are psychometric models used for educational and psychological measurement.
DCMs are multidimensional, and result in a categorical profile of skills demonstrated by the respondent on the assessment.
r-dcm provides a suite of tools for implementing DCMs in applied practice with R.
This includes the estimation and evaluation of DCMs ([measr](https://github.com/wjakethompson/measr)), reporting results ([thresholdr](https://github.com/r-dcm/thresholdr)), and example data sets ([dcmdata](https://github.com/r-dcm/dcmdata)).
